## Bugs to fix

- [ ] misplaced connection to DB and using callbacks 
- [ ] using console.log in production code 
- [ ] requiring routes files in the middle of the file 
- [ ] all required files should be listed on top 
- [ ] .eslintr.json should be place in main directory instead of config 
- [ ] credentials list API_KEY, urls should be placed in env file 
- [ ] empty handleError method with comment inside 
- [ ] connection to DB doubled: both in mongoDBhelpers and in app.js 
- [ ] not using try-catch to handle errors 
- [ ] using todether callbacks, promises and async-await 
- [ ] too few req validations 
- [ ] comments in the production code 
- [ ] controllers functionality placed in routes directoryâ€‹
